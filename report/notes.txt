=== [ Inadmissible heuristics ] ================================================

	* Heuristics using Manhattan distance.
		- If the pathfinding algorithm overestimates the distance H it may fail to
		  find the shortest path. For these cases we call the heuristics
		  inadmissible.

=== [ Treatment of ties ] ======================================================

	When two nodes have the same F score one must be chosen over the other. This
	choise will not affect the length of the path, but it may affect the path
	itself. Another way to put this is that depending on how ties are treated two
	different implementations of the A* algorithm may find different paths of
	equal length.

=== [ Cutting corners ] ========================================================

	The pathfinding algorithm can either allow or forbit diagonal steps to cut
	corners. Obviously this decision may affect the shortest path.
