=== [ Inadmissible heuristics ] ================================================

	* Heuristics using Manhattan distance.
		- If the pathfinding algorithm overestimates the distance H it may fail to
		  find the shortest path. For these cases we call the heuristics
		  inadmissible.

	* Hybrid heuristics (possible solution)
		- Instead of using pure Manhattan distance for the H cost we could use a
		  hybrid between the Manhattan distance and "as the crow flies".

		  Example: Let 's' and 'g' represent the start and goal locations
		  respectively. Let the cost of a horizontal or vertical step be 10 and
		  the cost of a diagonal step be 14 (floor(10*sqrt(2)).

		+-------+
		|     g |
		| s     |
		+-------+

		  The cost using Manhattan distance between 's' and 'g' is 1*10 + 4*10 =
		  50, since there is one vertical and four horizontal steps from 's' to
		  'g'.

		  Using a hybrid heuristic we could combine a horizontal and a vertical
		  step into a diagonal step which would cost 14 instead of 10+10=20. Using
		  this method the heuristic could no longer be inadmissible.

		  The cost using a hybrid heuristic would in this case be 1*14 + 3*10 =
		  44, since there is one diagonal and three horizontal steps from 's' to
		  'g'.

=== [ Treatment of ties ] ======================================================

	When two nodes have the same F score one must be chosen over the other. This
	choise will not affect the length of the path, but it may affect the path
	itself. Another way to put this is that depending on how ties are treated two
	different implementations of the A* algorithm may find different paths of
	equal length.

=== [ Cutting corners ] ========================================================

	The pathfinding algorithm can either allow or forbit diagonal steps to cut
	corners. Obviously this decision may affect the shortest path.
